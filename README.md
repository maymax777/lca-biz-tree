# Visualizing "Find the Least Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree"

The goal of the project is to visualize an algorithm that you will implement to find the Least Common Ancestor (LCA) of a Binary Tree (NOTE: not a BST) when given a tree and two nodes in that tree. The least common ancestor is defined as the closest relative to both of those nodes. For example, assume we have the following tree:

```
     3
    / \
   9   7
  / \   \
 2   6   4
```

For this tree, the lowest common ancestor for `2` and `6` is `9` because it is the closest relative to both of those. For `6` and `7` the answer is `3` because that is the closest relative.

## Requirements

1. The app should have an input field that allows us to input a binary tree as an array and convert it into the above tree structure. The method for doing this conversion is already defined in the `Node` file (feel free to implement your own, but you should be using the `Node` class as is without modification for this). It takes in an as input an array of the form `[3, 9, 7, 2, 6, null, 4]` which represents a level order traversal from left to right.
2. The app should take `Node` parsed above and visualize that tree similarly to the tree above (or however you wanna visualize it, get creative!)
3. The app should take in two numbers as input and return the LCA of those two numbers by visually marking the node in the tree
4. Write up a short (1 page max) explaining your approach, what bugs and TODOs need to be addressed, and what a future iteration might look like

## Assumptions

1. The input is a Binary Tree, not a Binary Search Tree
2. The values in the tree are unique, so you don't need to worry about duplicates
3. A `Node` DOES NOT have pointers to its parents. If you need to add other properties to aid with visualization you can do that, but the properties should not aid in finding the LCA

## Other

- Feel free to use `antd`, `material-design`, or your component library of choice for base components
- you can use external libraries for rendering the tree, but if you do, you MUST implement the bonus item below which visualizes what your algorithm is doing on the tree itself
  - the goal of this is to demonstrate your rockstar ability and it's hard to get signal on that if all the code is external libraries

## Bonus (NOT REQUIRED)

- Get creative with the visualization. Add styling, css animations, w/e you want.
- Add tests to your code
- [Stretch Goal] Animate the search for the LCA. You could write your LCA algorithm in such a way that you can step through the iteration and visualize what node is being processed and what checks are being done at those steps (see other above about using external libraries for rendering the tree)

## Deliverables

1. Once complete, zip up your code
2. Include either in the zip or separately your written documenation about the approach (requirement 4)
3. email the zip

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
